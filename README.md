# rust-template
For creating rust projects on vscode


## Get started

To get started with this template, once you've [generated the repository](https://github.com/chuukwudi/rust-template/generate), run the following `cargo` command (replace my-project with the name of your project):

```bash
cargo init --name my-project .
```

This will initialise the project with the name you provided. You can now start editing the `src/main.rs` file and start building your project.
